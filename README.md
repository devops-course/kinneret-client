## Installation
For the client to function properly, you need to run the installation script that downloads required libraries.
In the root folder run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will also run the bower installer.

## Running the client
To run the static web server that serves the client run the following command:
```
npm start
```
The server is listening on port 8000 of your localhost by default.
Any unknown resources requested by the server are re-routed to port 9000 on your localhost.
This is done to eliminate the need for specific CORS handling. It assumes the dropwizard server is listening on port 9000.

## Tests
The tests folder contains samples for both unit and e2e tests.  
`grunt test` - runs the unit test endless loop (used for debugging)  
`grunt protractor` - runs the e2e test
